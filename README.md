# IDLESPLINTER FIXTHEMATCH MARKET

We're running a bot-as-a-service platform (http://idlesplinter.xyz) to help users earn passive income from [Splinterlands](https://steemmonsters.com?ref=olvaus). **IdlesplinterFTM** is a market that allows our user to sell/trade their Fled tokens to maximize their profit.

> Splinterlands (n√© SteemMonsters) is a multiplayer fantasy card game within which thousands of gamers battle every day. Full transparency of the blockchain's distributed ledger enables gamers to see how many of each different card exists in the entire game. Every card is individually owned, which means that even the creators of the game cannot take them away from any player, and all players are free to buy, sell, or trade them just like physical trading cards.

## Fled token

Each **Fled token** has 2 properties:

- `account_name`: corresponding to Splinterlands accounts (which is currently Steem account)
- `match_type`: can be `rank` or `tournament`

Token owner can trade them freely on the [Stardust Marketplace](https://stardust.gg) or use them for their Splinterlands accounts. After using, the token will be burn and the bot will make sure the `account_name` account auto fled one `match_type` match against the user.
